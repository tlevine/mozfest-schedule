77,"<p>With the increasing emergence of large-scale source document dumps, journalism is realizing it has a growing document management problem. With this has come a shift from covering a single once-in-a-career smoking gun to organizing hundreds of smoking guns all at once. To get the the bottom of document dumps that are tens or hundreds of thousands of items deep, journalists are becoming archivists: creating organizational structures and indexes designed not to “”save it forever”"" as some might think, but rather to process the vast troves of source documentation generated over the life or a snapshot of a person or organization, and creating tools to make it indexable it to the point of usefulness by others. In this session, representatives of NYPL Labs, the experimental technology team at The New York Public Library, will share the basics of archival practice and work with the journalists who do or expect to work with these kinds of vast troves of primary source materials and along the way show them how to work with archival collections of all kinds.</p>",15:30,Fireside Chat,journalism,https://festival.etherpad.mozilla.org/journalism_glenn-greenwald-is-an-archivist-lessons-in-deep-archival-journalism-from-libraries,805,Glenn Greenwald Is An Archivist: Lessons In Deep Archival Journalism From Libraries,glenn-greenwald-is-an-archivist-lessons-in-deep-archival-journalism-from-libraries,<p>David Riordan</p>,14:00,,journalism-5

160,"<p>Donations are a powerful  method to support worthy causes, and billions of people donate funds to  support nonprofits doing great work all over the world. Yet, fundraising  infrastructure is often rooted in traditional modes of raising money,  like direct-mail and phone appeals. Many NGOs host events, rallies,  trainings, and other in-person gatherings. What if there were a  dead-simple way to chip in a few dollars on the spot, when individuals  are most engaged? The available tools are lacking in capturing support  in the momentum of those compelling moments. It’s time to think about  new ways that the web can empower people to make a difference. It’s time  for better tools, more disruption and substantial innovation! In this  session we will explore new ways people can donate to support causes  they care about using emerging mobile web technology, like Mozilla's  prototype app development tools.
