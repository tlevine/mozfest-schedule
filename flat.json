Yet, fundraising  infrastructure is often rooted in traditional modes of raising money,  like direct-mail and phone appeals. Many NGOs host events, rallies,  trainings, and other in-person gatherings. What if there were a  dead-simple way to chip in a few dollars on the spot, when individuals  are most engaged? The available tools are lacking in capturing support  in the momentum of those compelling moments. It\u2019s time to think about  new ways that the web can empower people to make a difference. It\u2019s time  for better tools, more disruption and substantial innovation! In this  session we will explore new ways people can donate to support causes  they care about using emerging mobile web technology, like Mozilla's  prototype app development tools.
